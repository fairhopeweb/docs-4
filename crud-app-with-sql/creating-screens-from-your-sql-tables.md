# Creating Screens from your SQL tables

Once Budibase knows about your SQL tables, it can autogenerate screens (the user interface) that allows listing, creating, editing a deleting of records from tables. 

Of course, these generated screens are completely customisable - but Budibase gives you a huge headstart.\


1. Go to the “Design” section.
2. In the left panel, click the “+” button, to create a new screen.
3. For the “Template”, choose “Vehicles - List”.
4. Click create

This produces a screen that lists row in the Vehicles table. You can now repeat the steps above for “Vehicles - New” and “Vehicles - Detail”, to give you “Create” and “Edit” screens. For these screens, it’s best to uncheck the “Create Link in navigation bar”.\
