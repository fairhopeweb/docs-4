# Components

Components are the building blocks of Budibase. They are used to construct your user interface. At budibase we use the Spectrum design system created by Adobe. This gives you a great out-of-the-box experience where things just work. As a plus you also get themes by default.

There are a number of components in Budibase. They can be found along the top of the preview window in the Design section.

### Using components

When you have added a component you will be able to see the options that you can tweak on the right side under the Settings bar. Some components also have a toolbar that will appear above it in the preview window.
