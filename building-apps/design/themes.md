# Themes \(coming soon\)

Budibase uses the Spectrum design system by Adobe. Included are four base themes; Lightest, Light, Dark, and Darkest.

If you are not satisfied with the base themes you can customize the options below:

* Primary colour - used for the action variant on buttons, form fields \(icons, checkboxes, radios, borders, and date pickers\), icon colours, etc.
* Primary color \(hover\) - like the previous one but when the element is hovered.
* Navigation bar background color: the background color of your navigation bar. This also includes the drawer menu when on mobile.
* Navigation bar text color - the text color of your navigation bar.
