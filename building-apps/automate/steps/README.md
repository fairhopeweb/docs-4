# Automation steps

In this section we will cover the the three main components of an automation and how they are used together to create the automation processes your app requires.

Once you have created a new automation you will find a panel on the left hand side of the builder, listing steps that can be added, initially only the list of triggers, once this is picked you will be presented with a list of logic and action steps.

When a step is added to your automation you can configure it in the right panel of the builder. The various defined inputs of the step will be listed and previous step outputs can be used, as discussed [later](../contextual-bindings.md).

In the following pages we will cover the three step types:

1. [Triggers](triggers.md)
2. [Logic](logic.md)
3. [Actions](actions.md)

Below is a quick overview of setting up a few steps as part of an automation.
