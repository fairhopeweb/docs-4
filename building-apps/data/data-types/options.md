# Options

The options data type stores options in the form of strings/text that are available for selection. When adding options, you must take a new line for each option. 



#### Creating an option column

The process for creating an option column takes a few seconds.

1. First, click the Create New Column button
2. Give your column a name - we used Department in the video above.
3. Choose options as your data type
4. Add your options - we added IT, Sales, HR in the video above
5. Click Save Column
6. Add data to your new column by [adding rows]()

#### 

#### Using the date/time data type

In the Design section, you can pull in information from your options column, using the [Repeater](../../design/components/repeater.md) component and [binding](../../design/binding.md).
