# True/False \(Boolean\)

True/False is a data type that has one of two possible values \(usually denoted as true/false, yes/no, Boolean\). Within your UI, this is usually displayed in the form of a checkbox.



#### Creating a true/false column

3. Choose True/False as your data type
4. Click Save Column
5. Add data to your new column by [adding rows]()

#### Using the true/false data type

In the Design section, you can pull in information from your true/false column, using the [Repeater](../../design/components/repeater.md) component and [binding](../../design/binding.md).
