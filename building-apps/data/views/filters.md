# Filters

One of the core features of [views](./) is the ability to filter rows according to particular criteria. When a Row is filtered, it is not deletedâ€”it's just hidden from the particular View you're using and remains within the table \(Views are virtual tables!\).

Try adding filters when:

* You  need to focus on rows that meet certain conditions \(e.g. Classes between May and June, and taught by Albert Einstein\).
* You need to display certain information, to certain people \(e.g Each sales person can only view their own commission\).

## How to create a new Filter
