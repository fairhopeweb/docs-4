# Finishing Touches

Our app is a simple Todo list, and we would like to display the list in the center of the page, without a navigation bar.

1. Add a new container to the Home screen.
2. In the component tree, drag your data provider inside the container.
3. Set the container’s Align Items property to “Center”
4. Click on your Home screen in the component tree, and change the “Layout” to “Empty Layout”. This will remove the nav bar.
5. Finally - set your theme to “Darkest”!
