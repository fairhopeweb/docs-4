# Creating a query that Lists Issues

We will use GitHub issues to represent our todo items. So, we need to create a query that will list GitHub issues.

1. On your API connector, click “Add Query”
2. Call your query “List Items”
3. The “Function” should be `GET`
4. For the “Path”, enter `/repos/<your_github_username>/<your_repo>/issues`.
5. Click on “Run Query”. This query should run successfully. The schema should be that of a GitHub issue.
6. Click “Save Query”
