# CRUD App with a REST API

This guide will show you how to build a CRUD application, with the Budibase REST API connector. For this example, we will build a Todo list, using GitHub Issues to store our items.  


If you want to follow along, you will need to:

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. [Create a GitHub access](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) token with the `repo > public_repo` scope checked.
3. Add a few issues to your repository, so that we have some data to test with.
