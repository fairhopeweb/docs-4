# Add search to a table

### Prerequisites

For Search to work, you need data.

For this quick demonstration, we will use the data within the CSV below. 

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/1000-sales-records.csv" caption="Sales.csv" %}

## Guide

After uploading the data above, Budibase autogenerated us 3 screens in the design section. Our table was called Sales, so our screens are:

* /sales/
* /sales/:id
* /sales/row/new

### Steps

* [ ] Click on the /sales/ screen
* [ ] Add the `Form` component
* [ ] In the settings panel, under Schema, select your table
* [ ] Move the new `Form` component above the `New Data Provider` component
* [ ] Add a `Text Field` component and make sure it is nested under the `Form` component
* [ ] In the settings panel, select the column you would like to search \(in our case, it's 'Country'\) and then add a placeholder \(for those using the CSV above, I used 'Search country' for my placeholder\)
* [ ] In the navigation tree, move the `New Data Provider` component underneath our `New Text Field` component

* [ ] In the settings panel for the `New Data Provider` component, click the Define Filters button
* [ ] Click add filter
* [ ] Select the column you would like to search \(in our case, Country\)
* [ ] You can then select 'Equals or 'Starts with'.
* [ ] Select the value dropdown, and select Binding
* [ ] Click the lightning bolt on the last input 
* [ ] Select {{ New Form.Fields.\[\[column\]\] }}
* [ ] Click Save, and Save again
