# Connecting to your SQL tables

The first step is to connect to your database.  


The connection options will be slightly different, depending on your database. The example below uses Postgres.   


Note that if you are connecting to a database on \`localhost\`, your host should be set to \`docker.host.internal\`, or \`172.17.0.1\` if running on Linux.  


Once you have input your connection details, click on “Fetch tables from database”. This will read all the tables in your database.
