# Users

Users in Budibase are global. To add, remove or edit users, have a look at the [User Management page](../admin/user-management.md).

### Creating or editing user roles

The Users Table in the data section is where you manage access, create and edit roles. These are then applied in the User Management page.

### Adding user meta data

You can also add columns that are specific to your application here. This data will only be available in this app.

{% hint style="info" %}
The User table in Budibase is a bit different to other tables that you can create in. You can't delete or create users or update some of their core information like first and last names. This is done in the User Management page of the portal.
{% endhint %}
