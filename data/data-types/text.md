# Text

The text data type stores text, including numbers - also known as a string.  A text column is a good choice if you want to store data like names, addresses, or simple custom data. It is a popular data type and one you are more than likely going to use.

#### 

#### Creating a text column

The process for creating a text column takes a few seconds.

1. First, click the Create New Column button
2. Give your text column a name - we used Name in the video above.
3. Due to the popularity of the text data type, it is shown by default; so there's no need to change it.
4. Click Save Column
5. Add data to your new column by [adding rows](../tables/rows.md)

#### 

#### Using the text data type

In the Design section, you can pull in information from your Text column, using the [Repeater](../../design/components/repeater.md) component and [binding](../../design/binding.md).
