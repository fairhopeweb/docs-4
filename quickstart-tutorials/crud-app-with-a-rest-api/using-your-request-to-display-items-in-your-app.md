# Using your request to display items in your app

Now that we have created our query, we want to display these items in our app.

1. Go to the design section.
2. In the Home screen, delete the default component.
3. Add new Data provider, setting the “Data” to “List Items” - i.e. our query.
4. Add a new Repeater, inside the Data provider.
5. Add a Paragraph element, inside the repeater.
