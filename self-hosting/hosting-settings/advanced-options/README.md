# Advanced options

In this section we'll cover some useful options for using your self hosted Budibase platform in production. These options aren't required for testing but we do recommend setting these up for any real production use cases. Below is a list of the options we have documented so far:

1. [Reverse proxy](reverse-proxy.md) - how to use your own domain as the URL for Budibase deployments and apps, as well as using existing certificates or certbot-auto to configure TLS/HTTPS.

If there is anything else you would like to see documented here, or an easier method to setup produced then please let us know by opening a [Github Discussion](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/discussions) with your suggestion!
