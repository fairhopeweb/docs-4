# Hosting methods

This section covers our guides for hosting Budibase with the different tools that we currently support. If we don't currently support a tool/framework that you'd like to see support for then let us know over at [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/discussions)!

1. [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.md) - the easiest method to get self-hosted budibase up and running.
2. [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md) - the easily scalable solution.
3. [Docker/Docker compose](docker-compose.md) - Run budibase on your own server using docker and docker-compose.
